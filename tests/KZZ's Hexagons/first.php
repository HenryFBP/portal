//PHP uses standard java type comments
/* As I said, java type comments */


 //Adding html tags to strings helps for echo
$temp = "<b>Was is das? </b>";

//echo prints out html code, so using tags is fine
echo $temp; 

//"." is the concation operator, used instead of "+"
echo $temp . "CHECK IT OUT";

echo "<h1>PHP h1</h1>";
